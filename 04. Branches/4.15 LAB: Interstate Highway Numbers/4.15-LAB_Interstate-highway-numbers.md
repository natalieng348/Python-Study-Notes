# 4.15 LAB: Interstate highway numbers

Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west. Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. Thus, I-405 services I-5, and I-290 services I-90. Note: 200 is not a valid auxiliary highway because 00 is not a valid primary highway number.

Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves. Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.

Ex: If the input is: `90` the output is: `I-90 is primary, going east/west.`

Ex: If the input is: `290` the output is: `I-290 is auxiliary, serving I-90, going east/west.`

Ex: If the input is: `0` the output is: `0 is not a valid interstate highway number.` 

Ex: If the input is: `200` the output is: `200 is not a valid interstate highway number.` 


## Solutions

```
# Take user input
highway_number = int(input())

# Global variables
is_primary = 1 <= highway_number <= 99
is_auxiliary = 100 <= highway_number <= 999
is_even = highway_number % 2 == 0

# Check if primary/auxiliary and going EW/NS
if is_primary:
    if is_even:
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is primary, going east/west.')
    else:
        print(f'I-{highway_number} is primary, going north/south.')
elif is_auxiliary:
    last_two_digits = highway_number % 100
    if last_two_digits == 0:
        print(f'{highway_number} is not a valid interstate highway number.')
    else:
        if is_even:
            print(f'I-{highway_number} is auxiliary, serving I-{last_two_digits}, going east/west.')
        else:
            print(f'I-{highway_number} is auxiliary, serving I-{last_two_digits}, going north/south.')
else:
    print(f'{highway_number} is not a valid interstate highway number.')
```
